        Returns:
            An array representing the pixels in the image, organized as follows

        Warning:
            Do not modify the returned image. The returned image is a reference to the
            captured image, so any changes will also affect the images returned by any

            Unlike get_color_image(), this function does not create a deep copy of the
            captured image, and is therefore more efficient.

    "2. Convert these raw inputs into numeric values (contour center, contour area, center distance, current velocity, etc.).\n",
    "3. Use these numeric values to calculate output values (speed, angle, etc.).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we saw two examples of step 2 when we turned a color image (a raw input) into the a center point and a contour area (numeric values).  In this section, we will build up two useful tools for step 3: turning these numeric values into output values.\n",

    "Frequently, an output value must fall within a certain range.  For example, the speed and angle sent to `rc.drive.set_speed_angle()` must be in the range $[-1, 1]$.  *Clamping* refers to the process of forcing a value into a particular range.  If the value is less than the minimum, it receives the minimum value, and if the value is greater than the maximum, it receives the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, clamp should return the following outputs:\n",
